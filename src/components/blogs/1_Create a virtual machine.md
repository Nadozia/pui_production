I will create a virtual ubuntu in Digital Ocean.

I chosed Toronto as it is closer and allow faster data transfer.


For now, i will use the basic droplet only as the resource is enough to hold a simple server. NVMe SSD have faster R/W speed (NVMe 3500MB/s vs SSD 500MB/s). It is just an one dollar upgrade. I think it is good to try it out.

Server is ready to use!!
Now we have the public IP address and the machine ready!
